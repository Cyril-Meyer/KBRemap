# KBRemap
C++ Keyboard remapper

##### How does it work ?
KBRemap is based on windows api call [GetKeyState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-getkeystate) and [SendInput](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winuser/nf-winuser-sendinput).

##### What's the point ?
A friend has a broken shift key, he needs this key to play StaCraft 2, I created this program to allow him to use the ALT key instead.
